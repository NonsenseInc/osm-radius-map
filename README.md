# osm-radius-map
draw a radius around a community border on osm

To try it, open https://nonsenseinc.github.io/osm-radius-map/index.htm?target=Viersen&level=6&radius=15 (you can adjust the paramters). The overpass-api-call will take a few seconds. Beware of rate limiting!

This is a proof-of-concept prototype. Do not expect it to be correct or work at all. Hints, advice and criticism is very welcome!
